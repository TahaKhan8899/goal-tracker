## Setting Up Cron Jobs

For reminders and weekly digests to work, you need to set up scheduled calls to two endpoints:

1. **Daily Reminders**: Set up a daily cron job to hit `/api/reminders/sendReminders`
2. **Weekly Digest**: Set up a weekly cron job (suggested: Sunday) to hit `/api/reminders/sendDigest`

You can use services like cron-job.org to set up these scheduled calls.

## Admin Access

Admin dashboard is available at `/admin` for users with admin emails.
Currently, this is hardcoded to `admin@example.com` for demonstration purposes.
